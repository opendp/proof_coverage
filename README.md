# OpenDP Proof Coverage Statistics

Run `count.py` to count, in the OpenDP Library:
* the number of functions
* the number of functions with proofs

Outputs are saved to `output.txt`.

Disclaimer: the counts are based on one code branch, and don't include all PRs.
The current `output.txt` is pointed at a particular branch that adds a significant number of proofs.
